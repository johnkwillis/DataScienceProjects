2. New prediction array:
    * This array shows the models probabilistic classification of the image on the left. After training the model with the training data
   it can predict the identity of new images. However, the vector initially generated by the model cannot be used for classification because
      it has not been normalized. The softmax function solves this problem by changing the values in the array so that they all add
      up to 1. After the vector has been normalized, the argmax function can be utilized to find the index value of the most probable class.
      In this case, the normalized array indicated that the model was 100% sure the image was a sandal (argmax = 6).

3. What is the shape of the images test set?
    * 10,000 images that are 28x28
