    <h1>National Security Directives: Trends Over Time</h1>
    <p>John Willis</p>

    <h2>Introduction and Background</h2>
    <p>National Security Directives (NSDs) are influential yet enigmatic tools that empower the President to independently shape or amend national security policy, thereby testing the constitutionally mandated system of checks and balances. This confidential nature often keeps NSDs away from extensive academic scrutiny (Gordon 2007, 350). This analysis seeks to unveil the cryptic world of NSDs and investigate the reasoning behind Congress's approval of the National Security Act (NSA), a move that seems to undercut its own supervisory role. Further, the paper undertakes an in-depth exploration of the establishment and evolution of the National Security Council (NSC), delves into government assessments of NSD issuance, and offers a unique quantitative analysis of a comprehensive NSD dataset.</p>

    <h3>Creating the National Security State</h2>
    <p>The National Security Act of 1947 was principally driven by the need for a better-structured framework for American national security and military operations, following President Roosevelt's improvised approach during World War II (Nelson 1985, 374). When Truman took office, there was an overarching demand for significant policy revisions. Despite debates over potential centralization of power, the NSA was passed due to the collective efforts of the Army, Secretary of Defense George Marshall, and President Truman, thereby establishing a more coherent national security policy framework (CQ Almanac 1946). Following its passage, Truman moved to consolidate the NSC under his control, culminating in the Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1949 that officially moved the NSC into the executive office (Falk 1964, 407). Truman's robust leadership, despite the NSA's broad discretionary powers, was key in shaping his national security agenda. Over time, the NSC's role grew, becoming the primary forum for national security policy discussions, independent of Congress, and strengthening its policymaking influence, especially during the Cold War era.</p>
    
    <h3>National Security Directives (NSDs)</h3>
    <p>National Security Directives (NSDs) are instructions issued by or on behalf of the president to the National Security Council (NSC), distinct from NSC Policy Papers, which are policy recommendations and analyses produced by the NCC (GAO 1992, 2). Historically, each presidency has used its first NSD to outline the NSC organization and a system for classifying these directives. From Truman to Kennedy, NSDs were issued under one title; however, starting with Nixon, NSDs were categorized into two or sometimes three types. The first type, review or study directives, instructs the NSC to thoroughly analyze a policy or situation related to US national security or foreign relations. The second type, considerably more impactful, enables the president to modify and establish policy, direct policy implementation, and allocate federal resources. A detailed overview of the varying nomenclatures for NSDs across presidencies is provided in Table 1 below.</p>

    <h3>Internal Investigations into NSDs</h3>
    <p>Since the National Security Act's (NSA) enactment, several studies have examined the use of National Security Directives (NSDs) as instruments of presidential power. The first study, commissioned by the National Security and International Affairs Division within the General Accounting Office (GAO) in 1988, probed the potential for presidents to use NSDs to initiate and direct national policy without adequate oversight. Although the study only considered declassified NSDs, it found that a significant number of these directives established policy, directed policy implementation, or authorized the commitment of federal resources. This finding implies the potential for substantial presidential influence and suggests that classified NSDs may create policy and allocate federal resources even more significantly.</p>
    <p>Subsequent studies by the GAO in 1992 and the Congressional Research Service in 2007 further highlighted the secretive nature of NSDs and their use as potent policy-making tools. The 1992 study found that the Bush Sr. Administration employed NSDs to create or implement policy, often excluding Congressional committees from relevant discussions. It also contrasted the secrecy surrounding NSDs with the transparency of Executive Orders, which are typically made publicly available immediately (GAO 1992, 4). The 2007 study, while more broadly focused on presidential directives, reiterated the unique evasion of publishing guidelines by NSDs and provided valuable insight into different presidents' practices for naming and issuing NSDs. Despite these findings, empirical analyses of NSD issuance in the context of presidential political strategy are limited. In the following section, I address this literature gap by analyzing NSD issuance patterns across Congressional sessions, aiming to illuminate potential connections between these directives and broader political goals.</p>
    
    <h2>Analysis</h2>
    <p>This paper, after a thorough literature review on National Security Directives (NSDs), utilizes a quantitative approach to analyze a comprehensive dataset of every NSD issued since President Kennedy. While early NSC organization posed challenges, a more consistent cataloging system from Kennedy onward allows for a detailed investigation of NSD issuance and classification across presidents and Congressional sessions. The findings suggest that presidents have used NSDs to unilaterally establish and change policy, especially under divided Congresses, echoing past studies' findings. Additionally, the analysis reveals an increase in declassification rates in recent years, suggesting a promising trend for future NSD studies.</p>

    <p>The dataset I created, containing the name, title, date, and classification status of every NSD from Kennedy to Trump, reveals an intriguing pattern. Figure 1 shows that over two-thirds of all NSDs were issued under divided Congresses, with presidents issuing an average of 61.17 NSDs under divided Congresses compared to 53.85 under unified ones. This disparity supports the theory that presidents may utilize NSDs to circumvent congressional oversight. Moreover, there appears to be a normal-like distribution of NSD use over time, with more sporadic usage following Bush Sr.'s administration. Shifting to trends in NSD declassification, Figure 2 presents the percentage of NSDs remaining classified per president and Congressional session. Periods where the United States was engaged in an armed conflict, such as the 101st, 107th, and 111th Congresses, show a high proportion of classified NSDs, suggesting presidents' use of NSDs to bypass Congress during these times. Figure 3, however, illustrates a significant shift towards declassification since 2009, with most NSDs from Ford to Bush Sr. nearly entirely declassified and subsequent presidents following suit rapidly. This trend towards greater transparency, likely influenced by Obama's emphasis on declassification in E.O. 13526, implies a promising future for NSD studies.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The National Security Act (NSA) marked a pivotal shift in the U.S.'s national security strategy, enhancing the president's influence through mechanisms such as National Security Directives (NSDs). Our analysis revealed that NSDs serve as significant policy tools, especially in the face of a divided Congress, affecting both domestic and international landscapes. While they potentially undermine Congressional oversight, the increasing rate of declassification offers promise for greater transparency in the future.</p>
    <p>The covert nature of NSDs, coupled with their vast impact on national security and international relations, calls for continued academic scrutiny. Even though these instruments challenge Congress's constitutional authority and can disrupt the governmental balance of power, the rising declassification trend provides optimism. This transparency can ensure alignment with the nation's democratic principles and reinforce the checks and balances system fundamental to U.S. governance. Future research must further illuminate the role of NSDs, promoting their transparent and accountable use to protect our democratic values.</p>
