    <h2>Part 1</h2>
    <iframe src="categories.html" width="100%" height="815px"></iframe>
    <ul>
      <li>A) The most immediate thing that I noticed looking at this parallel categories chart is that people who are college educated tend to vote on a more regular basis compared to folks who have some or no college education. Although a majority of the college educated sample considered themselves “sporadic” voters, this was due to the fact that most of the sample itself was “sporadic” voters. Another key takeaway is that income does not seem to have a noticeable significant impact on voter behavior. There is a small difference with the upper two brackets, but not significant.</li>
      <li>B) Looking at the chart, it is clear that folks in the upper two income brackets are educated at a much higher rate than the lower two. Most noticeably, in the 125k+ bracket there are few people that come from below College level, and a similar pattern can be seen from the 75-125k bracket. Most of the people who had some college or none made up the lower two brackets indicating the college educated people tended to earn more.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Part 2</h2>
    <iframe src="bubble.html" width="100%" height="700px"></iframe>
    <ul>
      <li>A) 2020 is a standout year on the bubble chart. For one, this was a year where few people actually voted in person so the absentee rate is extremely high. As we can see compared to other years, where most counties float below the 30% absentee rate, during the 2020 election that rate skyrocketed and so did overall turnout as a result. To add to this, it was a presidential election which, as we can see in the 2016 data, leads to higher turnout
    </ul>
    <h2>Part 3</h2>
    <iframe src="map.html" width="100%" height="650px"></iframe>
    <ul>
      <li>A) The key takeaway from the map is that voting is highly concentrated into the cost of VA and that turnout is low in the western rural part of VA.
    </ul>
