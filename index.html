    <h1>National Security Directives: Effective Tools or Unconstitutional Shortcuts?</h1>
    <h3>John Willis</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>National Security Directives (NSDs), powerful yet enigmatic tools, grant the president the authority to unilaterally establish or modify national security policy and allocate federal resources, thereby challenging the Constitutional checks and balances imposed by Congress and the Judiciary. Despite the profound implications of these instruments on national security policy and international relations, the academic study of NSDs remains riddled with gaps, primarily due to the long-standing confidentiality surrounding their issuance. Moreover, as NSDs lack publication requirements, presidents possess the exclusive prerogative to decide when, or if, to declassify them (Gordon 2007, 350). While executive orders and signing statements attract considerable public attention, NSDs often remain shrouded in secrecy for years, if not decades, and even Congress is unable to compel a president to declassify or grant limited access to an NSD. This paper seeks to unravel the enigma of NSDs, delving into the question: Why would Congress endorse the National Security Act (NSA) if it created a tool that undermines their presidential oversight authority? To address this conundrum, I investigate the creation and evolution of the National Security Council under the Truman administration, review previous internal government analyses of NSD issuance, and present a novel analysis of a comprehensive NSD dataset that I compiled myself. The results of my analysis support prior findings that presidents use NSDs to implement policy, especially in the face of Congressional opposition.</p>
